* Jun Zhuang is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-cs/). Prior to joining Boise State University, he obtained a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)](https://science.iupui.edu/) in 2023, advised by Prof. [Mohammad Al Hasan](http://cs.iupui.edu/~alhasan/), and received an M.S. degree in Computer Science from [University at Buffalo (UB)](http://www.buffalo.edu/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Mingchen Gao](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~mgao8/).
* He aims to investigate **trustworthy** and **robust** ML/AI systems/algorithms in multiple domains, such as **graphs**, **text**, and **quantum computing**. His recent research improved the robustness of graph neural networks via Bayesian inference models.
<!-- *His research interests include (but are not limited to) Bayesian statistics for graph representation learning, Open-set recognition, Biomedical image synthesis & segmentation, etc.-->

* <span style="color:red">He is looking for highly self-motivated Ph.D. students generally interested in his research topics.</span>
* Please send him an email with the title “Ph.D. Application (Fall24) - {Name} - {Research Interests}” and the following information.
  1. Introduce your **education, technical, and research background** in your CV;
  2. Introduce your **motivation** (why do you want to pursue a Ph.D. degree?), your **past research experience** (what are the connections between our research interests?), your **future research interests** (how my research can help you; please feel free to propose any idea that you would like to work with me), and your **future career plan** (what’s your plan after graduation?).
* <span style="color:red">Prospective students</span> are expected to be passionate about research. Strong programming skills and a solid foundation in statistics will be a big plus. Students with other STEM majors are welcome to contact me.
* What can I do for my Ph.D. students?
  1. Provide weekly hands-on instructions on their research projects;
  2. Collaborate with students on top-tier conference (or journal) papers;
  3. Help students build strong professional profiles for future career.
