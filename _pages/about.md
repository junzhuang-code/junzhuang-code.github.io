# About Me
* Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in computer science (CS) at [Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)](https://science.iupui.edu/), advised by Prof. [Mohammad Al Hasan](http://dmgroup.cs.iupui.edu/home.php). Previously, I gained my MS degree (CS) from [University at Buffalo (UB)](http://www.buffalo.edu/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Mingchen Gao](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~mgao8/). Prior to joining UB, I was a foreign exchange trading specialist at China Merchants Bank. My main responsibility was to execute transaction orders and cash management. Before that, I obtained my first MS degree (Finance) at [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/) in 2013 and received my bachelor's degree (Safety Engineering) from [South China University of Technology (SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) in 2011.
* Recently, I'm interested in studying how to defend Graph Neural Networks. My research interests also include (but not limited to) Open-set Recognition (Non-exhaustive Learning), Biomedical Image Synthesis, and Dark-net Exploration, etc.
* <b>I'm actively looking for a summer internship in 2022</b>. Welcome to contact me if you are recruiting Ph.D. student. Thank you!
